When the camera is blocked, the shader erases the elements in front of it in a circle in the center of the viewport. The elements that are erased or not can be toggled dynamically, including individual map elements.\n\nWarning! Currently there is a major setback when using this plugin, which is caused by how texture bundles are organized in the engine by default. Mountains share their textures/materials with other tileset elements, which means they cannot be filtered separately. Other map elements such as face sprites (trees, for example) are all erased together too. It is recommended to leave map filtering OFF to avoid this setback entirely. Mountains have another issue as well: they are not erased from view unless the camera target (the hero, by default) is in front of the top of the mountain exactly. This can be fixed by placing fix sprites inside the mountains, which is admittedly bothersome, but works. I plan to fix those issues in a later patch, sorry for the inconvenience.","name":"Hide object on block view","parameters":[{"defaultValue":{"k":12,"v":2},"description":"Radius of the \"erase circle\", in squares","id":-1,"name":"Erase radius"}]}
